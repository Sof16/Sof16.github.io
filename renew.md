# About Renew

Renew (Reference Net Workshop) is a Java-based editor and simulator for Petri Nets, developed by Olaf Kummer, Frank Wienberg, Michael Duvigneau, Lawrence Cabac, Michael Haustermann, and David Mosteller. The developers are affiliated with the Theoretical Foundations Group of the Department of Informatics at the University of Hamburg, Germany.

Renew excels in modeling and simulating Petri nets, particularly through its support for the Nets-within-Nets paradigm. This paradigm enables hierarchical modeling, where individual nets can be encapsulated within larger nets, allowing for modular design and the representation of complex systems. By integrating object-oriented properties, Renew further enhances modeling flexibility, as users can define classes and objects that can be manipulated within the Nets-within-Nets framework.

In order to run our work, please first [download the Renew software](http://www.renew.de).

*Note: For this work, the version Renew 2.6 was used.* 

# Process to run a simulation

### Step 1 : Download the simulation software Renew

Please refer to the [Renew Installation window](../renew.html).

### Step 2 : Download the example files

[Please click here to access the files on Github](https://github.com/Sof16/Sof16.github.io).

### Step 3 : Open the example in Renew

The procedure for the launching on the example in Renew is:

1. Open the Powershell in the directory with the example files, containing the Java script Eval.java.
2. Execute "javac Eval.java" in the Powershell
3. Open Renew from the Powershell ( type in the path of the directory containing the Renew software adding \renew ) 
4. In Renew, open all the files with the extension .rnw.

### Step 4 : Simulate
