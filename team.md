# The Team 


![Sofia Hustiu](hustiu_photo.jpg)

**Sofia Hustiu**  
Received the B.S. and M.Sc. degrees in Automatic Control and Applied Informatics from the Technical University of Iasi, Romania, in 2018 and 2020, respectively.  

She finished her Ph.D. in 2025 following a joint program between the University of Zaragoza, Spain, and the Technical University of Iasi, Romania. During the academic year 2021–2022, she participated in an ERASMUS+ program and completed a 3-month research stay at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.  

Her research interests include path planning and task assignment for multi-agent systems based on discrete event systems and high-level specifications.  

She is also a teaching assistant at the Technical University of Iasi, Romania, where she teaches **System Theory** and **Path Planning Strategies for Multi-Agent Systems**.

**Joaquín Ezpeleta**  
Attained both his M.S. degree in Mathematics and his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Zaragoza, Spain.  

Currently, he is a Full Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Systems Engineering at the same university, where he teaches formal methods for both sequential and concurrent programming. His primary research focuses on modeling, analyzing, and synthesizing control for concurrent systems, employing formal techniques such as Petri nets and temporal logic. Additionally, he explores applications of these techniques in cloud technologies and in the parallel processing of computationally intensive problems.

**Cristian Mahulea**  
Received his B.S. and M.Sc. degrees in Control Engineering from the Technical University of Iasi, Romania, in 2001 and 2002, respectively, and his Ph.D. in Systems Engineering from the University of Zaragoza, Spain, in 2007.  

He is currently a Full Professor at the University of Zaragoza, where he chaired the Department of Computer Science and Systems Engineering from 2020 to 2024. He has also served as a visiting professor at the University of Cagliari, Italy.  

His research interests include discrete event systems, hybrid systems, mobile robotics, and healthcare systems. He has been a Visiting Researcher at the University of Sheffield (UK), Boston University (USA), University of Cagliari (Italy), and ENS Paris-Saclay (France).  

Cristian has served as an Associate Editor for *IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering (TASE)* and *IEEE Control Systems Letters (L-CSS)*. He is currently an Associate Editor for *IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control (TAC)*, the *International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)*, *Discrete Event Dynamic Systems: Theory and Applications (JDES)*, and *IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)*. Additionally, he was the General Chair of ETFA 2019.
